	To build a style sheet, we need to define the rules that select elements and apply various
style properties to them. Besides element selectors, previously introduced, the two most
common forms of CSS rules are id selectors, which are used to specify a rule to bind to a
particular unique element, and class selectors, which are used to specify a group of
elements.
	Elements are named in (X)HTML using the id attribute, which is found on nearly any
element. As an example, here we identify a particular h1 tag as the primary headline of
the document.

	It produces a paragraph with a yellow background and black, Arial, italicized text that is
spaced with a 150 percent line height. What has happened is that the various rules are
applied by selectors, and some property values are inherited from their enclosing parent
elements. Using a small parse tree, Figure 4-3 shows just how the rules cascade downward
to the enclosed elements, which explains the motivation behind the name Cascading Style
Sheets.
	In some cases, rules are even overridden by later-defined or more-precise rules that may
even be within inline styles.

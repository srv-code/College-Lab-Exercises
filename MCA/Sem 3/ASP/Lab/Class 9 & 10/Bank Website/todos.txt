Caching:
	DbStrings.dbConnectionString

To Dos:
	force caching tuple count after a row insertion & deletion
	fix the Debug.Print syntax also
	fix the sql and procedureName variables also 
	capitalize the sql statement keywords
	create the necessary procedures 
	create a unified procedure for selecting paged and sorted records for all tables

Scenarios:
	* borrowers table operations:
		[can: view; cannot: add,edit,delete]

	* payments table operations:
		[can: view; cannot: add,edit,delete]
					
	* loans table operations:
		[can: view,add,delete; cannot: edit]

		view the records:
			show only tuples with cleared=false

		borrows a loan:
			if branch assets is >= amount requested, then
				deduct the amount from branches.assets by amount requested
				adds a record in loans table, with cleared=false
				if no previous entry were made for that customer and branch, then
					add a row in borrowers table with that customer and branch name
			else 
				reject the insertion
				find a way to communicate the rejectiin message to the UI page controls

		makes loan payment :
			inscrease the amount of branches.assets by amount requested
			adds a record in payments table
			update the corresponding row from loans table with cleared=true
			if thats the last record for the customer from that branch, then
				delete the tuple from borrowers for that customer & branch name

1. Use the Iris dataset and split the dataset into 2 parts for training and testing. Ratio: 70-30. Train a classifier model using kNN for k=3. Predict the class labels for the test instances  and tabulate the confusion matrix.
2. Use the cars dataset and create a linear model to predict  distance based on the speed of 190. Find if there is correlation between speed nand distance and visualize the relationship.
3. Use the mtcars dataset predict mpg using distance horsepower  and weight. [Hint: Use glm()]
4. Using the Iris dataset create a classification tree to predict species based on all predictor attributes.
5. Use the Iris dataset to create 3 clusters of the data usiong the k-means function and visualize the final clusters using group scatter plot.
